# Aircraft-Designer
This is a program helps in preliminary aircraft design and optimization.
It is an object-oriented MATLAB program can
a) Visualize an aircraft design
b) Get important aircraft performance parameters (left coefficent, stability derivatives, etc. )
c) Get important aircraft performance graphs (Cl/Cd graph, Drag/speed graph, etc. )

1. Please read "Brief Intro to MATLAB Code" to get more details about the code.
2. "mainExample.m" construct a example aircraft. Run it. The "testUAV" object is the aircraft builded based on given parameters.  
    The example is a design for mission like "Fulton Skyhook"
    The following example image is an overview of the final design of the aircraft.
